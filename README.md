# Flutter Chat

This is a fun attempt to learn flutter by writing a chat application.  The data store is firebase which holds the chat messages so multiple clients will see the same stream of conversation.


## Features
The main text entry box at the top of the page is for new chat messages.  The textarea below is to show the history of chat messages as has occurred historically.

## Future improvements
* Segregate into "chatrooms" (possibly via a chat_room field on the record)

## Issues
There is currently a permission error because the 30 days of open firebase permissions has expired.  This should be fixed by monday Feb 26, 2024.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute please reach out to me on our slack channel. This repository is what gets built with the `flutter build web` command and is exported content from this build folder.  The full repo is currently private ðŸ˜ž sorry

### Apologies !!
This repository doesn't yet contain enough content to mandate a full readme but will improve in the future!
